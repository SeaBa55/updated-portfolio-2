# Unit 16 Project 2 Homework: Professional Materials

Now that you've built a full-stack web application and have another project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but is still *critical* on your journey as a developer.


## Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring projects 1 and 2 and at least four exemplary homework assignments.

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring projects 1 and 2 and four exemplary assignments. 

* Updated resume

* Updated LinkedIn profile

## Instructions

1. [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)
2. [GitHub Profile](#updated-github-profile)
3. [Updated Resume](#updated-resume)
4. [Updated LinkedIn](#updated-linkedin)

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should have the following content:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * Screenshot of the deployed application

* Deploy your portfolio to GitHub Pages


#### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.


### Updated GitHub Profile 

* If you haven't yet, now is the time to update the following in your GitHub profile: 

    * Profile picture

    * Bio

    * Location

    * Email

    * Link to your portfolio

* Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 

* Pin some repos that you want to highlight

  * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

  * Click "Customize your pins"

  * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

  * Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files

* Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code. 


### Updated Resume 

Submit a clear, concise and compelling resume, tailored to the type of job youâ€™re looking for.


### Updated LinkedIn Profile 

Update your LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github and portfolio.
